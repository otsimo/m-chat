a3.content = '<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><body><p>The M-CHAT is validated for screening toddlers between 16 and 30 months of age, to assess risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The M-CHAT can be administered and scored as part of a well-child check-up, and also can be used by specialists or other professionals to assess risk for ASD. The primary goal of the M-CHAT was to maximize sensitivity, meaning to detect as many cases of ASD as possible. Therefore, there is a high false positive rate, meaning that not all children who score at risk for ASD will be diagnosed with ASD. To address this, M-CHAT have developed a structured follow-up interview for use in conjunction with the M-CHAT; it is available at the two websites listed above. Users should be aware that even with the follow-up questions, a significant number of the children who fail the M-CHAT will not be diagnosed with an ASD; however, these children are at risk for other developmental disorders or delays, and therefore, evaluation is warranted for any child who fails the screening.<br/><br/>The M-CHAT can be scored in less than two minutes. Scoring instructions can be downloaded from http://www.mchatscreen.com or www.firstsigns.org. We also have developed a scoring template, which is available on these websites; when printed on an overhead transparency and laid over the completed M-CHAT, it facilitates scoring. Please note that minor differences in printers may cause your scoring template not to line up exactly with the printed M-CHAT. Children who fail 3 or more items total or 2 or more critical items (particularly if these scores remain elevated after the M-CHAT Follow-up Interview) should be referred for diagnostic evaluation by a specialist trained to evaluate ASD in very young children. In addition, children for whom there are physician, parent, or other professional’s concerns about ASD should be referred for evaluation, given that it is unlikely for any screening instrument to have 100% sensitivity.</p></body>';

Autism affects one in every 68 children and one in every 42 boys. Cost a family around $60.000 every year. We at Otsimo are proposing a new approach to screen autism via using mobile apps.<br/><br/> Does My Child Have Autism? is a unique iPhone application that uses M-CHAT™. Our goal is to lower the age of diagnosis of autism.<br /><br /> We want to work with you to gather meaningful data. We at Otsimo are proposing a new approach to screening ASD using mobile apps. The insights gained from this study may help develop ideas on how to manage these differences in symptoms.<br/><br/> If you are over 18 years old, we invite you to join the screening. You do not need to know any child diagnosed with autism or have concerns about it to join this screening.</p><p>Your participation in this study is voluntary.
