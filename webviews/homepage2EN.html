            <p>
                Our aim is democratizing the autism screening.<br /><br /> We collebarate with Dr. Yankı Yazgan(researcher) to make accessible autism screening to everyone. Autism affects one in every 68 children and one in every 42 boys. Cost a family
                around $60.000 every year. We at Otsimo are proposing a new approach to screen autism via using mobile apps. <br/><br/> Does My Child Have Autism? is a unique iPhone application that uses M-CHAT™. Our goal is to lower the age of diagnosis
                of autism.
