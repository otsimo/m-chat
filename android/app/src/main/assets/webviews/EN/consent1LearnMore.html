        Our aim is democratizing the autism screening.<br /><br /> We collebarate with Dr. Yankı Yazgan(researcher) to make accessible autism screening to everyone. Autism affects one in every 68 children and one in every 42 boys. Cost a family around
        $60.000 every year. We at Otsimo are proposing a new approach to screen autism via using mobile apps. <br/><br/> Does My Child Have Autism? is a unique iPhone application that uses M-CHAT™. Our goal is to lower the age of diagnosis of autism.
        <br /><br /> We want to work with you to gather meaningful data. We at Otsimo are proposing a new approach to screening ASD using mobile apps. The insights gained from this study may help develop ideas on how to manage these differences in symptoms.<br/><br/>        If you are over 18 years old, we invite you to join the screening. You do not need to know any child diagnosed with autism or have concerns about it to join this screening.
